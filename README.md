# DoorHandler
This is a door handler/extender electronic project to monitor (almost) any type of door bells using a light sensor, a transmitter and a receiver module. The light sensor periodically checks the door phone if the signal is lit or not and sends a pulse to the receiver, which can be anywhere in the house and can provide visual and/or auditory signals to the home owners.
